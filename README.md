# LPG-LEAKAGE-DETECTOR-AND-NOTIFIER
An IoT based project that detects leakage of LPG gas and notifies the user.

The project does the following tasks.
1. Monitors the status of LPG.
2. Sends the live data over the cloud.
3. Buzzer sounds whenever the leakage is detected.
4. LED displays the message.
5. A text and call alert is sent to the user whenever leakage occurs.
6. An android application shows the details of cloud data.

The project uses following hardware and software components:
1. A microprocessor i.e NodeMCU
2. LPG Leakage Sensor
3. Buzzer
4. OLED
5. GSM Module with an active SIM Card
6. MIT App Inventor
7. Arduino IDE
8. Thingspeak cloud connectivity
